### Roadmap

- [ ] VIP characters: In-game representations of the amazing people supporting the game on Patreon.
- [ ] Aging: A simple enough feature to implement, for now your stars will stay young forever.
- [ ] Categories Matter: Currently categories are for only flavour and doesn't affect the sales of the movies. There'll be trends in future and they will affect them.
- [ ] Bank Loans: Currently when you run out of money the only option is to restart, this should change with the loans your trusty bank around the corner provides.
- [ ] Population sliders: For your dreams of filming an uncensored all female Asian orgy.
- [ ] Category filtering: For more extreme categories like fisting, rape-roleplaying, incest-roleplaying, cuckolding etc. an option to turn them on in settings.
- [ ] Founding a studio: For now you can only produce with what you have as a single person. That should change when you get yourself the next big brand name.
- [ ] Filming locations: Pool, a massage center, changing room of a shopping mall, an office with a black couch in it, an alien spaceship filming set, you name it!
